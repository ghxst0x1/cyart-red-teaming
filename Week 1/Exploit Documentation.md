# Exploit Documentation
Target : Metasploitable2 Date: January 22, 2026 Operator: Red-Lead-01

## Reconnaissance
During the enumeration phase, a network scan identified an aging Linux server running **vsftpd version 2.3.4**. This version is historically significant due to a "supply chain" compromise where a backdoor was intentionally inserted into the source code for a brief window in 2011.

## Exploit
The exploit selected was `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`. The mechanism is triggered by sending a specific sequence of characters—a "smiley face" :)—within the FTP username. This causes the server to spawn a hidden shell listening on port 6200.

## Payload
In this specific Metasploit module, the payload is relatively simple: cmd/unix/interact. Unlike more complex stagers, this payload provides direct interaction with the spawned shell, granting the operator immediate command execution capabilities on the underlying Unix system.

## Access
By gaining a root shell through this exploit, we established a high-privileged foothold within the target machine. This initial access point serves as a beachhead for further internal network movement and lateral traversal.

## Post-Exploitation
During post-exploitation, the machine scanned for other vulnerabilities and also setup a **persistence** to keep the *foothold* on the machine.
